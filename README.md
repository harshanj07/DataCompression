# Video Compression: Encoding and Decoding
This project demonstrates video compression using AV1 codec for encoding MP4 to AVI (via libsvtav1 for faster encoding) and decoding AVI back to MP4 using OpenCV. The encoder employs CRF and preset tuning for quality and speed, while the decoder utilizes frame-by-frame processing. It calculates and displays compression ratios after decoding.
libsvtav1 is an open-source library for encoding video in the AV1 codec format.
